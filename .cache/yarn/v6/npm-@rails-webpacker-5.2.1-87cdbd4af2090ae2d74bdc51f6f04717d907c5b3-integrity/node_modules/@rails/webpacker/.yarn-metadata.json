It coexists with the asset pipeline,\nas the primary purpose for webpack is app-like JavaScript, not images, CSS, or\neven JavaScript Sprinkles (that all continues to live in app/assets).\n\nHowever, it is possible to use Webpacker for CSS, images and fonts assets as well,\nin which case you may not even need the asset pipeline. This is mostly relevant when exclusively using component-based JavaScript frameworks.\n\n**NOTE:** The master branch now hosts the code for v5.x.x. Please refer to [4-x-stable](https://github.com/rails/webpacker/tree/4-x-stable) branch for 4.x documentation.\n\n<!-- START doctoc generated TOC please keep comment here to allow auto update -->\n<!-- DON'T EDIT THIS SECTION, INSTEAD RE-RUN doctoc TO UPDATE -->\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n- [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)\n- [Features](#features)\n- [Installation](#installation)\n  -

Sass and CSS\n- Images and fonts\n- PostCSS - Auto-Prefixer\n- Asset compression, source-maps, and minification\n- CDN support\n- React, Angular, Elm and Vue support out-of-the-box\n- Rails view helpers\n- Extensible and configurable\n\n## Installation\n\nYou can either add Webpacker during setup of a new Rails 5.1+ application\nusing new `--webpack` option:\n\n```bash\n# Available Rails 5.1+\nrails new myapp --webpack\n```\n\nOr add it to your `Gemfile`:\n\n```ruby\n# Gemfile\ngem 'webpacker', '~> 5.x'\n\n# OR if you prefer to use master\ngem 'webpacker', git: 'https://github.com/rails/webpacker.git'\nyarn add https://github.com/rails/webpacker.git\nyarn add core-js regenerator-runtime\n```\n\nFinally, run the following to install Webpacker:\n\n```bash\nbundle\nbundle exec rails webpacker:install\n\n# OR (on rails version < 5.0)\nbundle exec rake webpacker:install\n```\n\nOptional: To fix [\"unmet peer dependency\" warnings](https://github.com/rails/webpacker/issues/1078),\n\n```bash\nyarn upgrade\n```\n\nWhen `package.json` and/or `yarn.lock` changes, such as when pulling down changes to your local environment in a team settings, be sure to keep your NPM packages up-to-date:\n\n```bash\nyarn install\n```\n\n### Usage\n\nOnce installed, you can start writing modern ES6-flavored JavaScript apps right away:\n\n```yml\napp/javascript:\n  ├── packs:\n  │   # only webpack entry files here\n  │   └── application.js\n  │   └── application.css\n  └── src:\n  │   └── my_component.js\n  └── stylesheets:\n  │   └── my_styles.css\n  └── images:\n      └── logo.svg\n```\n\nIn `/packs/application.js`, include this at the top of the file:\n\n```js\nimport 'core-js/stable'\nimport 'regenerator-runtime/runtime'\n```\n\nYou can then link the JavaScript pack in Rails views using the `javascript_pack_tag` helper.\nIf you have styles imported in your pack file, you can link them by using `stylesheet_pack_tag`:\n\n```erb\n<%= javascript_pack_tag 'application' %>\n<%= stylesheet_pack_tag 'application' %>\n```\n\nIf you want to link a static asset for `<link rel=\"prefetch\">` or `<img />` tag, you\ncan use the `asset_pack_path` helper:\n\n```erb\n<link rel=\"prefetch\" href=\"<%= asset_pack_path 'application.css' %>\" />\n<img src=\"<%= asset_pack_path 'images/logo.svg' %>\" />\n```\n\nIf you are using new webpack 4 split chunks API, then consider using `javascript_packs_with_chunks_tag` helper, which creates html\ntags for a pack and all the dependent chunks.\n\n```erb\n<%= javascript_packs_with_chunks_tag 'calendar', 'map', 'data-turbolinks-track': 'reload' %>\n\n<script src=\"/packs/vendor-16838bab065ae1e314.js\" data-turbolinks-track=\"reload\"></script>\n<script src=\"/packs/calendar~runtime-16838bab065ae1e314.js\" data-turbolinks-track=\"reload\"></script>\n<script src=\"/packs/calendar-1016838bab065ae1e314.js\" data-turbolinks-track=\"reload\"></script>\n<script src=\"/packs/map~runtime-16838bab065ae1e314.js\" data-turbolinks-track=\"reload\"></script>\n<script src=\"/packs/map-16838bab065ae1e314.js\" data-turbolinks-track=\"reload\"></script>\n```\n\n**Important:** Pass all your pack names when using `javascript_packs_with_chunks_tag`\nhelper otherwise you will get duplicated chunks on the page.\n\n```erb\n<%# DO %>\n<%= javascript_packs_with_chunks_tag 'calendar', 'map' %>\n\n<%# DON'T %>\n<%= javascript_packs_with_chunks_tag 'calendar' %>\n<%= javascript_packs_with_chunks_tag 'map' %>\n```\n\n**Note:** In order for your styles or static assets files to be available in your view,\nyou would need to link them in your \"pack\" or entry file.\n\n### Development\n\nWebpacker ships with two binstubs: `./bin/webpack` and `./bin/webpack-dev-server`.\nBoth are thin wrappers around the standard `webpack.js` and `webpack-dev-server.js`\nexecutables to ensure that the right configuration files and environmental variables\nare loaded based on your environment.\n\nIn development, Webpacker compiles on demand rather than upfront by default. This\nhappens when you refer to any of the pack assets using the Webpacker helper methods.\nThis means that you don't have to run any separate processes. Compilation errors are logged\nto the standard Rails log.\n\nIf you want to use live code reloading, or you have enough JavaScript that on-demand compilation is too slow, you'll need to run `./bin/webpack-dev-server` or `ruby ./bin/webpack-dev-server`. Windows users will need to run these commands\nin a terminal separate from `bundle exec rails s`. This process will watch for changes\nin the `app/javascript/packs/*.js` files and automatically reload the browser to match.\n\n```bash\n# webpack dev server\n./bin/webpack-dev-server\n\n# watcher\n./bin/webpack --watch --colors --progress\n\n# standalone build\n./bin/webpack\n```\n\nOnce you start this development server, Webpacker will automatically start proxying all\nwebpack asset requests to this server. When you stop the server, it'll revert back to\non-demand compilation.\n\nYou can use environment variables as options supported by\n[webpack-dev-server](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/) in the\nform `WEBPACKER_DEV_SERVER_<OPTION>`. Please note that these environmental\nvariables will always take precedence over the ones already set in the\nconfiguration file, and that the _same_ environmental variables must\nbe available to the `rails server` process.\n\n```bash\nWEBPACKER_DEV_SERVER_HOST=example.com WEBPACKER_DEV_SERVER_INLINE=true WEBPACKER_DEV_SERVER_HOT=false ./bin/webpack-dev-server\n```\n\nBy default, the webpack dev server listens on `localhost` in development for security purposes.\nHowever, if you want your app to be available over local LAN IP or a VM instance like vagrant,\nyou can set the `host` when running `./bin/webpack-dev-server` binstub:\n\n```bash\nWEBPACKER_DEV_SERVER_HOST=0.0.0.0 ./bin/webpack-dev-server\n```\n\n**Note:** You need to allow webpack-dev-server host as an allowed origin for `connect-src` if you are running your application in a restrict CSP environment (like Rails 5.2+). This can be done in Rails 5.2+ in the CSP initializer `config/initializers/content_security_policy.rb` with a snippet like this:\n\n```ruby\n  Rails.application.config.content_security_policy do |policy|\n    policy.connect_src :self, :https, 'http://localhost:3035', 'ws://localhost:3035' if Rails.env.development?\n  end\n```\n\n**Note:** Don't forget to prefix `ruby` when running these binstubs on Windows\n\n### Webpack Configuration\n\nSee [docs/webpack](docs/webpack.md) for modifying webpack configuration and loaders.\n\n### Custom Rails environments\n\nOut of the box Webpacker ships with - development, test and production environments in `config/webpacker.yml` however, in most production apps extra environments are needed as part of deployment workflow. Webpacker supports this out of the box from version 3.4.0+ onwards.\n\nYou can choose to define additional environment configurations in webpacker.yml,\n\n```yml\nstaging:\n  <<: *default\n\n  # Production depends on precompilation of packs prior to booting for performance.\n  compile: false\n\n  # Cache manifest.json for performance\n  cache_manifest: true\n\n  # Compile staging packs to a separate directory\n  public_output_path: packs-staging\n```\n\nor, Webpacker will use production environment as a fallback environment for loading configurations. Please note, `NODE_ENV` can either be set to `production`, `development` or `test`.\nThis means you don't need to create additional environment files inside `config/webpacker/*` and instead use webpacker.yml to load different configurations using `RAILS_ENV`.\n\nFor example, the below command will compile assets in production mode but will use staging configurations from `config/webpacker.yml` if available or use fallback production environment configuration:\n\n```bash\nRAILS_ENV=staging bundle exec rails assets:precompile\n```\n\nAnd, this will compile in development mode and load configuration for cucumber environment\nif defined in webpacker.yml or fallback to production configuration\n\n```bash\nRAILS_ENV=cucumber NODE_ENV=development bundle exec rails assets:precompile\n```\n\nPlease note, binstubs compiles in development mode however rake tasks\ncompiles in production mode.\n\n```bash\n# Compiles in development mode unless NODE_ENV is specified\n./bin/webpack\n./bin/webpack-dev-server\n\n# compiles in production mode by default unless NODE_ENV is specified\nbundle exec rails assets:precompile\nbundle exec rails webpacker:compile\n```\n\n### Upgrading\n\nYou can run following commands to upgrade Webpacker to the latest stable version. This process involves upgrading the gem and related JavaScript packages:\n\n```bash\nbundle update webpacker\nrails webpacker:binstubs\nyarn upgrade @rails/webpacker --latest\nyarn upgrade webpack-dev-server --latest\n\n# Or to install the latest release (including pre-releases)\nyarn add @rails/webpacker@next\n```\n\n## Integrations\n\nWebpacker ships with basic out-of-the-box integration. You can see a list of available commands/tasks by running `bundle exec rails webpacker`.\n\nIncluded install integrations:\n\n- [React](./docs/integrations.md#React)\n- [Angular with TypeScript](./docs/integrations.md#Angular-with-TypeScript)\n- [Vue](./docs/integrations.md#Vue)\n- [Elm](./docs/integrations.md#Elm)\n- [Svelte](./docs/integrations.md#Svelte)\n- [Stimulus](./docs/integrations.md#Stimulus)\n- [CoffeeScript](./docs/integrations.md#CoffeeScript)\n- [Typescript](./docs/typescript.md)\n- [Erb](./docs/integrations.md#Erb)\n\nSee [Integrations](./docs/integrations.md) for further details.\n\n## Paths\n\nBy default, Webpacker ships with simple conventions for where the JavaScript\napp files and compiled webpack bundles will go in your Rails app.\nAll these options are configurable from `config/webpacker.yml` file.\n\nThe configuration for what webpack is supposed to compile by default rests\non the convention that every file in `app/javascript/packs/*`**(default)**\nor whatever path you set for `source_entry_path` in the `webpacker.yml` configuration\nis turned into their own output files (or entry points, as webpack calls it). Therefore you don't want to put anything inside `packs` directory that you do not want to be\nan entry file. As a rule of thumb, put all files you want to link in your views inside\n\"packs\" directory and keep everything else under `app/javascript`.\n\nSuppose you want to change the source directory from `app/javascript`\nto `frontend` and output to `assets/packs`. This is how you would do it:\n\n```yml\n# config/webpacker.yml\nsource_path: frontend\nsource_entry_path: packs\npublic_output_path: assets/packs # outputs to => public/assets/packs\n```\n\nSimilarly you can also control and configure `webpack-dev-server` settings from `config/webpacker.yml` file:\n\n```yml\n# config/webpacker.yml\ndevelopment:\n  dev_server:\n    host: localhost\n    port: 3035\n```\n\nIf you have `hmr` turned to true, then the `stylesheet_pack_tag` generates no output, as you will want to configure your styles to be inlined in your JavaScript for hot reloading. During production and testing, the `stylesheet_pack_tag` will create the appropriate HTML tags.\n\n### Resolved\n\nIf you are adding Webpacker to an existing app that has most of the assets inside\n`app/assets` or inside an engine, and you want to share that\nwith webpack modules, you can use the `additional_paths`\noption available in `config/webpacker.yml`. This lets you\nadd additional paths that webpack should lookup when resolving modules:\n\n```yml\nadditional_paths: ['app/assets']\n```\n\nYou can then import these items inside your modules like so:\n\n```js\n// Note it's relative to parent directory i.e. app/assets\nimport 'stylesheets/main'\nimport 'images/rails.png'\n```\n\n**Note:** Please be careful when adding paths here otherwise it\nwill make the compilation slow, consider adding specific paths instead of\nwhole parent directory if you just need to reference one or two modules\n\n## Deployment\n\nWebpacker hooks up a new `webpacker:compile` task to `assets:precompile`, which gets run whenever you run `assets:precompile`. If you are not using Sprockets, `webpacker:compile` is automatically aliased to `assets:precompile`. Similar to sprockets both rake tasks will compile packs in production mode but will use `RAILS_ENV` to load configuration from `config/webpacker.yml` (if available).\n\nWhen compiling assets for production on a remote server, such as a continuous integration environment, it's recommended to use `yarn install --frozen-lockfile` to install NPM packages on the remote host to ensure that the installed packages match the `yarn.lock` file.\n\n## Docs\n\n- [Development](https://github.com/rails/webpacker#development)\n  - [Webpack](./docs/webpack.md)\n  - [Webpack-dev-server](./docs/webpack-dev-server.md)\n  - [Environment Variables](./docs/env.md)\n  - [Folder Structure](./docs/folder-structure.md)\n  - [Assets](./docs/assets.md) - [CSS, Sass and SCSS](./docs/css.md) - [ES6](./docs/es6.md), [Target browsers](./docs/target.md)\n    - [Props](./docs/props.md)\n    - [Typescript](./docs/typescript.md)\n  - [Yarn](./docs/yarn.md)\n  - [Misc](./docs/misc.md)\n- [Deployment](./docs/deployment.md)\n  - [Docker](./docs/docker.md)\n  - [Using in Rails engines](./docs/engines.md)\n  - [Webpacker on Cloud9](./docs/cloud9.md)\n- [Testing](./docs/testing.md)\n- [Troubleshooting](./docs/troubleshooting.md)\n- [v3 to v4 Upgrade Guide](./docs/v4-upgrade.md)\n\n## Contributing\n\n[![Code Helpers](https://www.codetriage.com/rails/webpacker/badges/users.svg)](https://www.codetriage.com/rails/webpacker)\n\nWe encourage you to contribute to Webpacker!
